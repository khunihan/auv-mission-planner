Underwater Vehicle Mission Planner

Web Application Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

Description: The AUV Mission Planner is a web-based application that enables users to design and simulate autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions using an interactive map interface. Developed with Flask and Leaflet.js, the application allows users to click on the map to define a sequence of mission waypoints, which can be repositioned or removed as needed. Users input global mission parameters such as depth, speed, battery capacity, vehicle weight, and ocean current conditions. These values are applied uniformly across the entire mission. The app calculates total horizontal distance using the Haversine formula, estimates mission duration based on effective ground speed (accounting for ocean currents), and computes both horizontal and vertical energy consumption using realistic physical models. A final ascent to the surface is also included in the energy calculations. Upon submission, the application provides a detailed mission summary including estimated power requirements, total battery usage, and whether the available battery capacity is sufficient to complete the mission. Designed for simplicity and clarity, the tool is ideal for students and professionals in ocean engineering or marine robotics looking to validate basic AUV mission plans.
